# proxy

nginx config to reverse-proxy requests to webtech.union.rpi.edu to various services.

Right now, it proxies:

- [/](https://webtech.union.rpi.edu) to [WebTech site](https://github.com/wtg/site)
- [/services/identity/](https://webtech.union.rpi.edu/services/identity/) to [Identity](https://github.com/wtg/identity)
